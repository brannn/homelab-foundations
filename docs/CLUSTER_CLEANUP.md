# Cluster Cleanup and Flux Repair

**Date**: 2025-07-14  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Objective**: Restore Flux functionality and clean up broken GitOps state

## Current Situation

### Issues Identified
- **Flux GitOps Broken**: Kustomization stuck on old revision with tmp filesystem errors
- **MetalLB Missing Configuration**: IPAddressPool not deployed, services using node IPs instead of pool IPs
- **Monitoring Stack Deleted**: Flux accidentally deleted working Grafana/Prometheus during malfunction
- **Storage Foundation Stable**: Longhorn and MinIO working correctly via Helmfile (foundation architecture)

### Root Cause
Flux reconciliation failure caused by:
1. **Persistent tmp filesystem issues** preventing kustomization updates
2. **Missing RBAC permissions** (now fixed)
3. **Stuck revision state** preventing new configuration deployment

## Cleanup Strategy

### Phase 1: Flux System Repair ✅
- [x] **Fixed RBAC**: Restored missing ClusterRoleBindings for Flux controllers
- [x] **Restarted Controllers**: Rolled out fresh helm-controller, kustomize-controller, source-controller
- [ ] **Clear Stuck State**: Force kustomization to use current Git revision
- [ ] **Verify Reconciliation**: Ensure Flux can apply current repository state

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Recovery
- [ ] **Deploy MetalLB Configuration**: Apply IPAddressPool via Flux
- [ ] **Restore Monitoring Stack**: Redeploy Prometheus + Grafana
- [ ] **Fix Service IPs**: Ensure LoadBalancer services get MetalLB pool IPs
- [ ] **Deploy HAProxy Ingress**: Complete the original HAProxy implementation

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] **Service Access**: Verify all UIs accessible via proper LoadBalancer IPs
- [ ] **GitOps Workflow**: Test end-to-end Git → Flux → Deployment
- [ ] **Storage Integration**: Confirm GitOps services can use foundation storage
- [ ] **HAProxy Testing**: Validate ingress controller functionality

## Current Status

### Working Components ✅
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Healthy and responsive
- **Foundation Storage**: Longhorn CSI (5% reservation, ~1.7TB available)
- **Object Storage**: MinIO tenant operational with 300GB pool
- **Flux Controllers**: Running with correct RBAC permissions

### Broken Components ❌
- **Flux Reconciliation**: Stuck on old Git revision
- **MetalLB Pool**: No IPAddressPool configured
- **Monitoring Stack**: Deleted by Flux malfunction
- **Service Access**: Using node IPs instead of LoadBalancer pool IPs

### Next Actions
1. **Force Flux kustomization refresh** to current Git state
2. **Monitor reconciliation** until MetalLB configuration deploys
3. **Verify LoadBalancer IPs** are assigned from pool range (10.0.0.240-250)
4. **Test service access** via proper external IPs
5. **Complete HAProxy deployment** and testing

## Architecture Maintained

The **foundation-first architecture** remains intact:
- **Foundation (Helmfile)**: Longhorn + MinIO stable and independent
- **GitOps (Flux)**: Being repaired to manage MetalLB, cert-manager, HAProxy, monitoring

This cleanup validates the architectural decision to keep storage outside GitOps - the foundation remained stable while GitOps components are being restored.

---

**Expected Outcome**: Fully functional GitOps-managed homelab with stable storage foundation and proper service exposure via MetalLB LoadBalancer IPs.
